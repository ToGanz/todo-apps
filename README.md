## ToDo Apps

I learned a lot of new technologies in the last months. To cement this knowledge and to be able to compare these technologies better, I wanted to build the same app in each technology. What I picked for this is the good old todo app.


The included features and the styling of these apps will always be the same.

Features:
You can create and delete projects. Within these projects you can create. Tasks can be edited, deleted and set to "complete". 

Styling:
Responsive layout built with css-grid
